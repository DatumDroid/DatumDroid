DatumDroid
==========

We believe that information should be available to anyone at any time in any form. One should not be bounded by only one media or source of information and should be able to explore other forms of the same information at that very instant. In order to achieve this goal of ours and to bridge the gap between different information media, especially the print and visual media, we created DatumDroid. We use Optical Character Recognition technology to recognize what you are reading and present you information in various forms (visual, graphical, print etc.) from popular sources, so that you do not miss what the world thinks about what you are reading!

Popular Sources: Feedzilla, Google Images, Guardian, Twitter and YouTube! More coming soon!
